## Description
**JavaLab** serves as an experimental playground and knowledge base for the Java programming language. 
The goal of this project is to maintain a set of tests that explore various nuances and intricacies of Java code. 
Each test aims to provide clear examples and answers to common (and not-so-common) challenges developers face when working with Java.
